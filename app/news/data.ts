<p>The Denza Z9 GT made its Australian debut at the 2026 Melbourne International Motor Show, and it's nothing short of a statement. BYD's premium sub-brand is aiming squarely at the Porsche Taycan with an all-electric grand tourer that produces a staggering <strong>850kW</strong> from three electric motors and sprints from 0–100 km/h in just <strong>2.7 seconds</strong>.</p>

<h2>What is the Z9 GT?</h2>
<p>The Z9 GT is a luxury electric shooting brake — think of it as a sleek wagon meets supercar. It's built on BYD's 800-volt high-voltage <strong>e³ platform</strong> and is the first Denza model to use the company's next-generation <strong>Blade Battery 2.0</strong> with Flash Ultra Charging capability.</p>

<p>Denza Australia Chief Operating Officer Mark Harland said at the reveal: <em>"Australia is a market that demands performance without compromise, and the Z9 GT has been engineered to meet or exceed expectations. It proves that electrification can deliver not just efficiency, but exhilarating performance, extraordinary safety and genuine long-distance usability."</em></p>

<h2>Powertrain & Performance</h2>
<p>The Z9 GT uses a tri-motor setup — one motor on the front axle and two on the rear — producing a combined 850kW. This gives it a claimed 0–100 km/h time of 2.7 seconds, which puts it in serious supercar territory. For context, the Porsche Taycan Turbo S does 0–100 in 2.8 seconds.</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Spec</th><th>Denza Z9 GT</th></tr>
<tr><td>Motor layout</td><td>Tri-motor (1 front, 2 rear)</td></tr>
<tr><td>System output</td><td>850kW</td></tr>
<tr><td>0–100 km/h</td><td>2.7 seconds</td></tr>
<tr><td>Battery</td><td>122.5kWh Blade Battery 2.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Range (CLTC)</td><td>1,036 km</td></tr>
<tr><td>DC fast charge</td><td>10–97% in 9 minutes (1500kW)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Suspension</td><td>Air suspension</td></tr>
<tr><td>Price (expected)</td><td>~$180,000–$220,000 (TBC, undercuts Taycan)</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Range & Charging</h2>
<p>The Z9 GT will ship with the large 122.5kWh battery, giving it a CLTC-rated range of <strong>1,036 km</strong>. Real-world range is estimated around <strong>600–650 km</strong> depending on driving conditions — still exceptional for a high-performance electric GT.</p>

<p>But the headline feature is <strong>Flash Ultra Charging</strong>. Using Blade Battery 2.0 technology, the Z9 GT supports up to 1500kW DC charging — nearly four times Australia's current fastest public charger (400kW). Denza claims a 10–97% charge in just <strong>nine minutes</strong> under optimal conditions. That's shorter than a typical petrol fill-up.</p>

<p><em>Note: Flash Ultra Charging requires specific dual-gun charging infrastructure — it can't hit 1500kW on a standard single CCS2 plug. At existing Australian fast chargers (350–400kW), you'll still get a very fast top-up, just not the headline 9-minute number.</em></p>

<h2>Interior & Technology</h2>
<p>Inside, the Z9 GT is packed with luxury features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nappa leather upholstery with massaging and ventilated seats</li>
<li>50-inch augmented reality head-up display</li>
<li>Premium sound system</li>
<li>Built-in fridge</li>
<li>128-colour ambient lighting</li>
<li>Air suspension for a plush, wafting ride</li>
</ul>

<h2>When Can You Get One?</h2>
<p>Denza has confirmed Australian deliveries will commence in <strong>Q3 2026</strong> (July–September). Pricing hasn't been announced yet, but it's expected to significantly undercut the Porsche Taycan's $181,000 starting price while offering more power, more range, and faster charging.</p>

<p>The Z9 GT will be the fourth Denza model in Australia, following the B5, B8, and D9. It's also the brand's first fully electric vehicle for the local market.</p>

<p>When Denza revealed the Z9 GT at the 2026 Melbourne Motor Show, the car's 850kW output and 2.7-second 0–100 time grabbed the headlines. But underneath all that performance is an even bigger story: <strong>Blade Battery 2.0</strong> and <strong>Flash Ultra Charging</strong>.</p>

<h2>What is Blade Battery 2.0?</h2>
<p>BYD's original Blade Battery, introduced in 2020, was already a game-changer. It used lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry arranged in long, thin cells — like blades — that could pass a nail penetration test without catching fire. This made it one of the safest EV battery designs on the market.</p>

<p>Blade Battery 2.0 builds on that foundation with significant improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher energy density</strong> — more range per kilogram of battery</li>
<li><strong>Faster charging speeds</strong> — up to 1500kW DC, compared to ~150kW for the original</li>
<li><strong>Improved thermal management</strong> — better heat dissipation during fast charging</li>
<li><strong>Longer cycle life</strong> — designed to last beyond 4,000 charge cycles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flash Ultra Charging: 10–97% in 9 Minutes</h2>
<p>The headline number is almost unbelievable: <strong>10% to 97% in nine minutes</strong>. To put that in perspective:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Charger type</th><th>Max speed</th><th>Time for ~87% charge</th></tr>
<tr><td>Standard home AC</td><td>7–11kW</td><td>8–12 hours</td></tr>
<tr><td>Current fast DC (Australia)</td><td>50–350kW</td><td>30–60 minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flash Ultra Charging</td><td>1500kW</td><td>~9 minutes</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Nine minutes. That's less time than it takes to order and collect a flat white at your local café.</p>

<h2>But Can Australia Even Support This?</h2>
<p>Here's the catch — Australia's current fastest public chargers top out at around <strong>350–400kW</strong>. So you won't be getting 1500kW charging at your local servo any time soon. However, the Z9 GT's battery is backward compatible with all existing CCS2 chargers. You'll just charge at whatever speed the charger supports.</p>

<p>The good news: charging infrastructure in Australia is rapidly expanding. The federal government's National Electric Vehicle Strategy includes funding for ultra-fast charging corridors along major highways. And companies like Chargefox, Evie Networks, and Tesla are all rolling out faster chargers.</p>

<p>Even at 350kW, the Z9 GT's 122.5kWh battery would charge from 10–80% in roughly 20–25 minutes — still faster than most EVs on sale today.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Range anxiety and charging time are the two biggest barriers to EV adoption in Australia. Blade Battery 2.0 and Flash Ultra Charging address both head-on. With 1000+ km of range and the ability to top up in under 10 minutes (when infrastructure catches up), the Z9 GT removes almost every excuse for not going electric.</p>

<p>The Z9 GT will be the first Denza in Australia to feature this technology. Expect it to trickle down to future BYD and Denza models over the next 12–24 months.</p>

<p>In early 2026, BYD officially launched its premium sub-brand <strong>Denza</strong> in Australia with two models that nobody expected: not sleek city EVs, but rugged, body-on-frame plug-in hybrid 4×4 SUVs. The <strong>Denza B5</strong> and <strong>B8</strong> arrived as direct challengers to the Toyota LandCruiser, Nissan Patrol, and Jeep Wrangler — but with a high-tech electrified twist.</p>

<h2>What is Denza?</h2>
<p>Denza (腾势) is BYD's premium brand, positioned above BYD's mainstream models. Think of it like Lexus is to Toyota, or Genesis is to Hyundai. While BYD focuses on accessible electric vehicles, Denza targets the luxury and performance segments.</p>

<p>The brand launched in China in 2010 as a joint venture with Mercedes-Benz (then Daimler). BYD took full control in 2024 and has since turned it into one of China's fastest-growing premium brands, selling over 126,000 vehicles in China in 2025.</p>

<h2>The Denza B8: Flagship Off-Roader</h2>
<p>The B8 is the bigger, more capable of the two. It's a full-size body-on-frame SUV with serious off-road hardware:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Spec</th><th>Denza B8</th></tr>
<tr><td>Engine</td><td>2.0L turbo-petrol 4-cylinder</td></tr>
<tr><td>Engine output</td><td>145kW / 350Nm</td></tr>
<tr><td>Front motor</td><td>200kW / 360Nm</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rear motor</td><td>300kW / 400Nm</td></tr>
<tr><td>System output</td><td>425kW / 760Nm</td></tr>
<tr><td>Battery</td><td>36.8kWh LFP (Blade Battery)</td></tr>

</table>

<h3>DiSus-P: The Secret Weapon</h3>
<p>One of the B8's standout features is <strong>DiSus-P</strong> — BYD's Intelligent Hydraulic Body Control System. It's the most advanced version of BYD's DiSus suspension technology (which comes in four tiers: DiSus-C, DiSus-A, DiSus-P, and DiSus-X). The same technology first debuted on the YangWang U8, BYD's G-Wagen competitor — it's what allows the U8 to do tank turns.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>200mm ride height adjustment</strong> — raise for off-road clearance (up to 310mm), lower for highway efficiency</li>
<li><strong>Hydraulic spring assembly at each wheel</strong> — individually adjusts to road surface conditions</li>
<li><strong>Active body control</strong> — reduces body roll in corners and nose dive under braking</li>
<li><strong>Water wading mode</strong> — raises the body to its maximum height for deep water crossings (890mm wading depth)</li>
</ul>
<p>DiSus-P uses hydraulic actuators at each corner of the vehicle, controlled by onboard sensors that read the road surface in real time. It can individually adjust each wheel independently, giving the B8 a ride quality and off-road capability that belies its body-on-frame construction.</p>

<h3>DMO: Dual Mode Off-road</h3>
<p>The B8 uses BYD's <strong>DMO (Dual Mode Off-road)</strong> platform — a super hybrid-based architecture purpose-built for rugged off-road vehicles. DMO is designed to deliver both efficient urban running and robust off-road performance. It pairs a turbocharged petrol engine with electric motors and a Blade Battery, combined with double-wishbone suspension and high-strength underbody protection.</p>
<ul>
<li>2.0L turbo-petrol engine (145kW / 350Nm) works with electric motors for combined 425kW</li>
<li>200kW front electric motor drives the front axle</li>
<li>300kW rear electric motor drives the rear axle</li>
<li>Rear mechanical differential lock (electrically actuated) is standard</li>
<li>Front locking differential is available on the 6-seat variant</li>
<li>Intelligent mode management maintains outstanding efficiency with up to 800km+ combined range</li>
</ul>

<h3>Terrain Modes</h3>
<p>The B8 offers an extensive suite of drive and terrain modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-road:</strong> Comfort, Eco, Sport</li>
<li><strong>Off-road:</strong> Rock, Snow, Sand, Mountain, Mud, Wading</li>
<li><strong>Special:</strong> Racing, Creep, Leopard Turn (tight turning), Towing, Anti-Skid</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interior & Practicality</h3>
<p>The B8 is available as a 6-seater ($97,990) or 7-seater ($91,000). Both feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nappa leather seats with heating, ventilation, and massage</li>
<li>15.6-inch rotating touchscreen (portrait/landscape)</li>
<li>Head-up display</li>
<li>Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) — power appliances from the car</li>
<li>Soft-close doors</li>
<li>Full-size spare tyre</li>
<li>3,500kg braked towing capacity</li>
<li>5-star ANCAP safety rating</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Denza B5: Compact Adventure SUV</h2>
<p>The B5 is the smaller, more affordable sibling. It shares the same DMO platform and DiSus-P suspension but in a more compact, lifestyle-oriented package aimed at younger buyers and outdoor enthusiasts.</p>

<p>While the B8 competes with LandCruiser and Patrol, the B5 targets vehicles like the Toyota Fortuner, Isuzu MU-X, and Jeep Wrangler — but with plug-in hybrid efficiency and significantly more power.</p>

<h2>What This Means for Australia</h2>
<p>The B5 and B8 represent something genuinely new in the Australian market: body-on-frame 4×4 SUVs that can also be daily commuters on pure electric power. With 100–115km of electric range, most Australian daily commutes can be done without using a drop of petrol. But when you want to go off-road or tow a caravan, the petrol engine and electric motors provide serious combined grunt.</p>

<p>The 5-star ANCAP rating for the B8 was also a significant milestone, addressing one of the common concerns about Chinese-brand vehicles in Australia.</p>

<p>While the B5 and B8 grabbed attention as rugged off-roaders, Denza's third Australian model targets a very different buyer: the <strong>Denza D9</strong> is a luxury electric people mover designed to replace the traditional family van with something far more refined.</p>

<h2>What is the D9?</h2>
<p>The D9 is a large, all-electric MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) that seats up to seven passengers. In China, it's been a massive hit — outselling the Toyota Alphard and becoming the best-selling premium MPV in the country. Now it's heading to Australia.</p>

<p>Think of it as a Kia Carnival or Volkswagen Multivan, but with the refinement of a Mercedes S-Class and the powertrain of an electric car.</p>

<h2>Design & Comfort</h2>
<p>The D9 is built for passengers, not drivers (though the driver's seat is plenty comfortable too). The key selling point is the second row:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two individual captain's chairs with electric adjustment</li>
<li>Heating, ventilation, and full massage function</li>
<li>Extendable leg rests (airline-style)</li>
<li>Individual entertainment screens</li>
<li>Retractable tables</li>
<li>Privacy curtains</li>
</ul>

<p>The third row isn't an afterthought either — it offers genuine adult-sized legroom, unlike most SUVs where the third row is only suitable for children.</p>

<h2>Powertrain</h2>
<p>The D9 for Australia is expected to feature:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Spec</th><th>Denza D9</th></tr>
<tr><td>Platform</td><td>e-Platform 3.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Battery</td><td>103kWh LFP (Blade Battery)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Range</td><td>600+ km (CLTC)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Drive</td><td>Front-wheel drive / AWD variants</td></tr>
<tr><td>Charging</td><td>DC fast charging supported</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Who is it For?</h2>
<p>The D9 targets families who want space and luxury without the fuel bills of a V6 people mover. It's also ideal for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Executive transport</strong> — airport transfers, corporate shuttles</li>
<li><strong>Rideshare/luxury hire</strong> — premium passenger experience</li>
<li><strong>Large families</strong> — genuine 7-seat comfort with electric efficiency</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> — flat floor, wide sliding doors, low step-in height</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Australian MPV Market</h2>
<p>Australia's people mover market has been dominated by the Kia Carnival for years, with the Volkswagen Multivan and Hyundai Staria offering alternatives. The D9 brings something none of them offer: full electric power combined with luxury-car levels of refinement.</p>

<p>Pricing hasn't been confirmed yet, but given the B8 tops out at $97,990, expect the D9 to sit in a similar bracket. That would make it competitive with a loaded Kia Carnival Hybrid or entry-level Volkswagen Multivan — but with significantly more technology and a fully electric driving experience.</p>

<p>The D9 is Denza's third model in Australia and demonstrates the brand's intent to cover multiple segments, from rugged off-roaders to luxury family transport.</p>

    category: "Technology",
    excerpt:
      "DiSus is BYD's self-developed intelligent body control system, exclusive to new energy vehicles. From the accessible DiSus-C to the extreme DiSus-X that lets a car drive on three wheels, here's every tier explained.",
    related: [

    content: `
<p>When BYD unveiled its DiSus Intelligent Body Control System in April 2023, it became the first Chinese automaker to own the full-stack intelligent vehicle body control technology — from the sensors to the actuators to the software that ties it all together. The system was developed exclusively for new energy vehicles (NEVs) and is now rolling out across BYD, Denza, and YangWang models.</p>

<h2>What Does "DiSus" Mean?</h2>
<p>The English name combines <strong>Di</strong> (the "D" from BYD — it appears across many BYD names, like the Xiao Di voice assistant and DiPilot self-driving system) with <strong>Sus</strong> (from suspension). The Chinese name is <strong>云辇 (Yǔnnián)</strong>, which loosely translates to something like "cloud carriage" — a poetic reference to the emperor's cloud-like chariot and the floating ride quality the system aims to deliver.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>Suspension technology has traditionally been the domain of European luxury brands. Mercedes-Benz has AIRMATIC and MAGIC BODY CONTROL, BMW has Adaptive M Suspension, and Porsche has PASM. DiSus represents BYD's answer — and in some ways, it exceeds what the Europeans offer, particularly in the hydraulic and extreme-performance tiers.</p>

<p>The key innovation is that DiSus is purpose-built for electric and hybrid vehicles, where heavy battery packs change the dynamics of how a car rides and handles. Traditional suspension tuning assumes a petrol engine and fuel tank — DiSus accounts for the weight and placement of batteries from the ground up.</p>

<h2>The Four Tiers</h2>

<h3>DiSus-C: Intelligent Damping Body Control</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> The entry-level tier, similar to CDC (Continuously Damping Control) variable damping systems found in many premium cars.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Electronic control valves inside each shock absorber adjust the damping force in real time. The system reads the road and adjusts each wheel independently to balance comfort and handling.</p>
<p><strong>Where you'll find it:</strong> BYD Han, Tang, and some Denza models. Several models gained DiSus-C via a simple OTA software update because they already had the necessary hardware installed from the factory.</p>

<h3>DiSus-A: Intelligent Air Body Control</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> The mid-tier system, using air suspension instead of traditional coil springs.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Air springs at each corner can raise or lower the vehicle by up to <strong>150mm</strong>. The system automatically adjusts ride height based on speed, road conditions, and driving mode. At highway speeds, it lowers the car for better aerodynamics and stability. Off-road, it raises it for extra clearance.</p>
<p><strong>Where you'll find it:</strong> The Denza N7 was the first model to feature DiSus-A, and it's now available across several BYD and Denza models with air suspension hardware.</p>

<h3>DiSus-P: Intelligent Hydraulic Body Control</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> The flagship tier. This is the system behind the YangWang U8's famous tank turns and water wading demonstrations. It uses hydraulic actuators rather than air springs or passive dampers.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Each wheel has its own hydraulic spring assembly that can be individually controlled. The system can raise or lower the suspension by up to <strong>200mm</strong> and can individually adjust each wheel's position in real time. On-board sensors — including LiDAR on some models — scan the road ahead and pre-adjust the suspension before the car reaches a bump or pothole.</p>
<p><strong>Key capabilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>200mm ride height adjustment — from slammed for highway to maximum clearance for off-road</li>
<li>Individual wheel control — each corner adjusts independently for flat cornering</li>
<li>Tank turn capability — the U8 can spin on the spot with hydraulic suspension keeping the body stable</li>
<li>Water wading mode — raises the body to maximum height for deep water crossings</li>
<li>Active body control — virtually eliminates body roll in corners and nose dive under braking</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where you'll find it:</strong> YangWang U8 (G-Wagen competitor) and <strong>Denza B8</strong> (flagship off-road SUV available in Australia). The B8's DiSus-P is what gives a $97,990 SUV ride quality that rivals vehicles costing two or three times the price.</p>

<h3>DiSus-X: Extreme Performance</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> The most extreme tier — found on the YangWang U9 electric supercar. Enables the U9 to drive on three wheels and "dance" by bouncing its body on command. A technology showcase proving the system has headroom far beyond what any road car currently needs.</p>

<h2>How the Tiers Compare</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Feature</th><th>DiSus-C</th><th>DiSus-A</th><th>DiSus-P</th><th>DiSus-X</th></tr>
<tr><td>Type</td><td>Variable damping</td><td>Air suspension</td><td>Hydraulic</td><td>Extreme hydraulic</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ride height</td><td>No</td><td>Up to 150mm</td><td>Up to 200mm</td><td>200mm+</td></tr>

<p>Every car brand has its defining platform — the underlying architecture that determines what a vehicle can do. Volkswagen has MEB, Hyundai has E-GMP, and Tesla has its skateboard chassis. For Denza, BYD's premium sub-brand, that platform is <strong>e³</strong> — pronounced "e cube".</p>

<h2>What is e³?</h2>
<p>The e³ platform is an industry-leading architecture developed specifically for Denza by BYD. According to BYD's own media materials, the name comes from its combination of <strong>three major components</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Powertrain architecture</strong> — compatible with both plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and pure electric (BEV) configurations, including the first use of Cell-to-Body construction in a super hybrid vehicle</li>
<li><strong>Control architecture</strong> — featuring three-motor independent drive and rear-wheel dual motor steering technology</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent architecture</strong> — focused on the deep integration of artificial intelligence and electrification</li>
</ol>

<p>Unlike a simple chassis that you bolt different bodies onto, e³ is a ground-up design where the battery, motors, suspension, and electronics are all engineered as a single integrated system.</p>

<h2>800-Volt High-Voltage Architecture</h2>
<p>One of the headline specs of the e³ platform is its <strong>800-volt high-voltage electrical system</strong>. Most EVs on sale today use 400V architecture. The move to 800V unlocks several major advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faster charging</strong> — higher voltage means more power can flow through the same cables with less heat. The Z9 GT on e³ supports up to 1500kW DC charging.</li>
<li><strong>Lighter wiring</strong> — 800V systems can use thinner cables (same power at higher voltage = lower current = thinner wires), saving weight.</li>
<li><strong>Better efficiency</strong> — less energy lost as heat in the electrical system, meaning more range per kWh.</li>
<li><strong>Higher motor performance</strong> — enables more powerful motors with better sustained output.</li>
</ul>

<p>Porsche was the first to bring 800V to production cars with the Taycan in 2019. BYD's e³ platform brings the same voltage level to Denza at a significantly lower price point.</p>

<h2>Tri-Motor Independent Drive</h2>
<p>The e³ platform supports a <strong>tri-motor layout</strong> — one motor on the front axle and two independent motors on the rear. This is the configuration used in the Z9 GT, producing a combined 850kW.</p>
<p>The dual rear motors enable features that a single rear motor can't achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Torque vectoring</strong> — sending different amounts of power to each rear wheel, improving cornering grip and stability</li>
<li><strong>Compass Turn</strong> — BYD's name for a tank turn, where the car can spin on the spot by driving one rear motor forward and the other backward</li>
<li><strong>Better traction control</strong> — if one wheel loses grip, the other can compensate independently</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rear-Wheel Dual Motor Steering</h2>
<p>Beyond just driving the wheels, the e³ platform's control architecture includes <strong>rear-wheel steering</strong> powered by the dual rear motors. At low speeds, the rear wheels turn in the opposite direction to the fronts, reducing the turning circle — handy for a 5-metre-long grand tourer in car parks. At high speeds, they turn in the same direction as the fronts for improved stability.</p>

<h2>Cell-to-Body (CTB) Construction</h2>
<p>The e³ platform uses BYD's <strong>Cell-to-Body</strong> technology, where the battery cells are integrated directly into the vehicle's structure rather than sitting in a separate battery pack. This:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increases structural rigidity (the battery becomes part of the chassis)</li>
<li>Lowers the centre of gravity</li>
<li>Maximises interior space by eliminating wasted volume around the battery pack</li>
<li>Improves crash safety — the battery structure adds strength to the floor</li>
</ul>
<p>BYD claims CTB gives the e³ platform a torsional rigidity comparable to luxury vehicles costing significantly more.</p>

<h2>Which Cars Use e³?</h2>
<p>The e³ platform is exclusive to Denza vehicles. Current and upcoming models built on e³ include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Denza Z9 GT</strong> — the all-electric grand tourer debuting in Australia in Q3 2026. Tri-motor, 850kW, 0-100 in 2.7s.</li>
<li><strong>Denza Z9</strong> — the sedan variant of the Z9 GT</li>
<li>Future Denza models as the brand expands globally</li>
</ul>

<h2>e³ vs e-Platform 3.0</h2>
<p>BYD's mainstream models (Atto 3, Seal, Dolphin, etc.) use <strong>e-Platform 3.0</strong> and its evolution <strong>e-Platform 3.0 Evo</strong>. The e³ platform is Denza's premium-exclusive upgrade:</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Feature</th><th>e-Platform 3.0</th><th>e³ (Denza)</th></tr>
<tr><td>Voltage</td><td>400V</td><td>800V</td></tr>
<tr><td>Motor layout</td><td>Single or dual</td><td>Up to tri-motor</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rear-wheel steering</td><td>No</td><td>Yes (dual motor)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Max DC charging</td><td>~150kW</td><td>Up to 1500kW (Flash)</td></tr>
<tr><td>CTB construction</td><td>Some models</td><td>Standard</td></tr>
<tr><td>Brand</td><td>BYD</td><td>Denza</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The e³ platform is what allows Denza to compete with Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes on technology and performance while maintaining a significant price advantage. It's the foundation that makes the Z9 GT's 850kW output and 1500kW charging possible.</p>
